# Now, inside your hello_world.py fi le, write Python code to take in a user’s name using the input() function and then print out the name.

# store an input variable called "name".
#  request user to input their name.
#   store in the "name" variable.
#    print out the value of the "name" variable.

# Use the same input() function and output approach to take in a user’s age and print it out.

# store an input variable called "age"
#  request user to input their age.
#   store im the "age" variable.
#   print out the value of the "age" variable.

# Finally, print the string “Hello, World!” on a new line (the new line will happen by default if you use a separate print statement to the one you used immediately above to print out the age, because each print statement automatically inserts an “enter”, or newline instruction, at the end).

# use the print function to display the string "Hello, World!".

name = input("Please enter your name: ")
print(name)

age = input("Please enter your age: ")
print(age)

print("Hello, World!")
