## An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were entered.

store input into a variable called "largest_number"
 store input into a variable called "input_number"
  loop:
  request input of a positive number from user
   if the input is zero, exit the loop
    retrieve the "largest_number" 
     print "largest_number" 
	 
## An algorithm that requests a user to input their name and then stores their name in a variable called first_name. Subsequently, the algorithm should print out first_name along with the phrase “Hello, World”.

Store input into a variable called "first_name"
 request user to input their name
  upon input retrieve varible called "first_name"
   print "first_name" along with the phrase "Hello, World"
  
## An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.


 store arbitrary intigers in variable called "group"
  store the count of "group" in a variable called "count"
   store the sum of "group" in variable called "sum"
    store the aritmetic avarage of "sum" / "count" into a variable called "arithmetic_avarage"
     loop:
      request input of integers from the user     
	   add the arbitrary intigers in "group"
	   if input is finished (based on a condition) calculate the "arithmetic_avarage"
        compute "arithmetic_avarage" as "sum" / "count"
         print "arithmetic_avarage"
	   
## algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.

get grocery list
 store grocery items in a varible called "grocery_list"
  loop:
   allow user to mark items as purchased or needed
    if grocery item has been marked as purcahsed from "grocery_list" remove item
     update "grocery_list" in alphabetical order.
      Print "grocery_list"

## An algorithm for the flowchart on the following page:

start - the flow chart begins
 read X, Y - which prompts the user to two values X and Y
  performs calculatons:
   S = X + Y (sum of X and Y)
   A = S / 2 (avarage of X and Y)
   P = X * Y (product of X and Y)
    output the results: It prints the value of S, A, and P
     Stop
